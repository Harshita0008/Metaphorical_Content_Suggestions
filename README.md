# Metaphorical_Content_Suggestions
Content Recommendations Powered by Metaphor API
# Content Recommendation with Metaphor Integration

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to enhance content recommendations using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model and the Metaphor API. It allows you to create a content recommendation assistant that provides users with personalized content suggestions based on their queries and enhances the recommendations with relevant URLs retrieved from the Metaphor neural search engine.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you'll need the following:

- **OpenAI API Key**: To access the GPT-3.5 Turbo model, you'll need an API key from OpenAI. You can obtain one by signing up on the OpenAI platform.

- **Metaphor API Key**: You also need an API key from Metaphor to use their neural search engine. You can acquire it by signing up on the Metaphor platform.

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/content-recommendation-metaphor.git
   cd content-recommendation-metaphor

## 1. Install Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries using pip.
pip install -r requirements.txt


## 2. Set API Keys: Open the content_recommendation.py script and replace the placeholders for API keys with your actual OpenAI and Metaphor API keys.
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
metaphor = Metaphor("YOUR_METAPHOR_API_KEY")


## 3. Run the Script: Execute the Python script to generate content recommendations and enhance them with Metaphor.
python content_recommendation.py


# Usage
- **Customize the USER_INPUT variable in the content_recommendation.py script to set the user's query**.

- **Modify the SYSTEM_MESSAGE to set the context and role for the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. It instructs the model to act as a content recommendation assistant**.

- **The script will generate an enhanced content recommendation and provide relevant URLs based on the user's input**.

# Output
The output of the script will look like this:

Enhanced Recommendation: [Content recommendation generated by GPT-3.5 Turbo]

Relevant URLs:
- [URL 1]
- [URL 2]
- [URL 3]
- ...

1. **Enhanced Recommendation**: This is the content recommendation generated by the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

2. **Relevant URLs**: This is a list of relevant URLs retrieved from the Metaphor API, providing additional resources or information related to the user's query.
Enhanced Recommendation: [Content recommendation generated by GPT-3.5 Turbo]

# Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**
- **openai**
- **metaphor-python**

# API Keys
To use this code, you need to obtain API keys from OpenAI and Metaphor. Replace the placeholders in the script with your actual API keys.
